## [Bitcoin Supply Bot](https://www.twitter.com/btcsupply)

Project is no longer maintained. The source coude remains valid but the bot has been discontinued.

##### NodeJS (main bot, actually running)

This little script is coded in NodeJS and is turning on Heroku.
To run the script : `node bot.js`

NodeJS bot files : bot.js, config.js, package.json

##### Python - DEPRECATED
I have made the same thing but in Python, just for fun.
You can run the script with `python bot.py` 

Python bot files : bot.py, twitter_acces.py

##### API 
API used to make it: [CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations](https://coinmarketcap.com/) & [Twitter REST APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
